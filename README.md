#SQL-Employee-Tracker
    
## Description
In this project, I utilized SQL in order to create a database, and make it accessible through node. Once the database is complete, a user has the option to view an entire registrar of employees. Additionally, the user has the functionality to add departments, roles, and employees. If an employee gets a promption and switches to a different role, the database can easily be updated through node as well.
